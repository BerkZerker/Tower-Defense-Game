   - [ ] Unit placement mechanics
   - [ ] Initial collision handling
   - [ ] Basic attribute system

3. Enemy System Initialization
   - [x] Enemy scene hierarchy established
   - [x] Enemy types configured
   - [ ] Basic enemy spawning
   - [ ] Simple movement patterns
   - [ ] Initial pathfinding

4. Combat System Base
   - [ ] Basic attack mechanics
   - [ ] Simple damage calculation
   - [ ] Initial projectile system
   - [ ] Basic targeting

## Recent Decisions

### Technical Decisions
1. Project Structure
   - Organized into clear directories (scenes, scripts, components, etc.)
   - Component-based architecture for units
   - Singleton pattern for core managers
   - Scene-based UI system
   - Local Godot API documentation integration for reference
   - Assets organized in specific texture directories for clarity

2. Development Approach
   - Focusing on core mechanics first
   - Implementing features iteratively
   - Mobile-first development mindset
   - Performance considerations from start
   - Using local API docs for accurate implementation

### Design Decisions
1. Unit System
   - Component-based unit design established
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Scene inheritance from base template
   - Unit-specific components added based on role
   - Shape resources properly declared for all areas

2. Enemy Types
   - Hierarchical difficulty scaling
   - Distinct abilities per type
   - Balanced stat progression
   - Component reuse across types

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. Grid System
   - Efficient pathfinding implementation
   - Clear visual feedback system
   - Touch input precision
   - Performance optimization

2. Unit Management
   - Object pooling requirements
   - State management
   - Component communication
   - Mobile performance

### Design Challenges
1. Gameplay
   - Balance between complexity and accessibility
   - Touch-friendly unit placement
   - Clear visual feedback
   - Intuitive controls

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Implement unit placement mechanics
2. Set up enemy spawning system
3. Create combat interaction system
4. Add basic pathfinding

### Short-term Goals
1. Functional prototype of core gameplay
2. Basic wave system
3. Combat mechanics implementation
4. Initial UI integration

### Upcoming Considerations
1. Card system integration
2. Resource management
3. UI system development
4. Save system implementation
