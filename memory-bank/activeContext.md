## Recent Decisions

### Technical Decisions
1. Project Structure
   - Optimized repository structure
   - Removed unnecessary directories and files
   - Organized into clear directories (scenes, scripts, components, etc.)
   - Component-based architecture for units
   - Singleton pattern for core managers
   - Scene-based UI system
   - Optimized local Godot API documentation
   - Streamlined asset organization

2. Development Approach
   - Focusing on core mechanics first
   - Implementing features iteratively
   - Landscape orientation optimizations:
     * Grid system adapted (16x9 cells)
     * Enemy spawn points repositioned
     * UI layouts configured for landscape
   - Performance considerations from start
   - Using streamlined API docs for efficient reference

### Design Decisions
1. Unit System
   - Component-based unit design established
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Scene inheritance from base template
   - Unit-specific components added based on role
   - Shape resources properly declared for all areas

2. Enemy Types
   - Hierarchical difficulty scaling
   - Distinct abilities per type
   - Balanced stat progression
   - Component reuse across types
   - Spawn points balanced for landscape layout

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. Grid System
