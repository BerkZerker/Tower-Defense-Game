# Project Intelligence

## Key Implementation Paths

- The project is using a custom grid implementation instead of TileMap. The grid is managed by the GridManager autoload singleton.
- The project is using a component-based architecture for units. The base components are HealthComponent, CombatComponent, MovementComponent, and AbilityComponent.

## User Preferences and Workflow

- The project is targeting mobile platforms with landscape orientation. The base resolution is 1280x720.

## Project-Specific Patterns

- The project is using the Singleton pattern for global managers such as GameState, GridManager, CardManager, and AudioManager.
- The project is using the Observer pattern for system communication such as unit state changes, combat events, wave progression, and card actions.
- The project is using the State Machine pattern for game states, wave management, unit behavior, and card states.
- The project is using the Command pattern for card actions, unit abilities, player inputs, and game commands.

## Known Challenges

- Implementing efficient pathfinding for the custom grid system.
- Optimizing performance for mobile devices.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- The project switched from TileMap to a custom grid implementation for better control and performance.

## Tool Usage Patterns

- The project is using Godot Engine 4.x with GDScript as the primary scripting language.
- The project is using Git for version control.
